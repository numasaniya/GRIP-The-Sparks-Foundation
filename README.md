TASK #6- Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm 



PROBLEM STATEMENT : Given the Iris dataset containing sepal and petal measurements of three species, the problem aims to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features using a decision tree algorithm. The objective is to develop a model that accurately classifies iris flowers into their respective species using the provided dataset. The decision tree will analyze the relationships between the features and species labels to make predictions, with the goal of achieving high accuracy and generalization on unseen data.
